Inspired by [https://github.com/Difegue/LCDonald](https://github.com/Difegue/LCDonald) this repo is an attempt to re-create some of LCD games playable in browser.

The idea is to re-use resources from glorious [Sonic McOrigins Plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qde4EjUn3SA&ab_channel=SonicCity%7CSonicNews%2CMedia%26Community) and re-implement games in pixi.js.

Plan atm is:

1. Re-create a single game
2. Make that playable on ghpages, test it
3. Keep adding more games
4. Wario-ware-style remixed mode, where games change in sequence 
5. Maybe scoreboard
